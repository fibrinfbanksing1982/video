Under slab plumbing repair is a critical service for homeowners dealing with hidden leaks or damaged pipes beneath their foundation. The cost depends on factors like pipe material, extent of damage, and accessibilityâ€”typically ranging from $1,500 to $4,000.  

Benefits include preventing structural damage, improving water pressure, and eliminating mold risks.
